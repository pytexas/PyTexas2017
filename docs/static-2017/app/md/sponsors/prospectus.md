# Sponsor Prospectus

Presenting PyTexas 2017, the 10th Python Community Conference for the
Texas Region. The purpose of PyTexas is to share Python-related knowledge and
enthusiasm in the form of presentations, coding sprints, "teach me" sessions,
and general networking among developers. It is run every year by volunteers
from around the region.

In 2012, PyTexas received national recognition from former Python Software
Foundation chair Steve Holden as a regional conference that deserves the Python
community's support.

Please consider sponsoring PyTexas 2017 through a financial contribution to the
non-profit PyTexas Foundation. Your contribution helps the Texas-area Python
community build a better conference, while also providing a targeted marketing
and community outreach opportunity.

We have provided this prospectus for potential sponsors to find out more about
the conference itself and available sponsorship opportunities. Our contact
information is available immediately below if you have any questions.

## Why Sponsor?

As a sponsor, your funding assistance will serve three critical purposes:

1. Highlight your presence within the Texas Python community. You can use this to:
    - Recruit your next engineer
    - Drive adoption of your product
    - Simply show your support for the Texas Python community
1. Build a better PyTexas by enabling organizers to attract attendees with
    standard conference perks such as printed t-shirts, catering,
    professional A/V, and more.
1. Help keep the cost of PyTexas low. PyTexas 2017 attendees will pay a modest
    registration fee of $85. Your sponsorship helps us keep this price
    reasonable for everyone involved.

## About the Python Language

Python is a general purpose, open source programming language popular for its
elegant, high-level, and cross-platform design. It is protected and promoted by
the [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf/). The PSF also aids
organizers of local conferences such as PyTexas with financial and logistical support.

Python has a wide range of practical uses, from simple scripts to large scale
enterprise applications to high volume websites such as YouTube.

Python is used for system administration, web development, building GUI
applications, scientific computing, game development, and as a "glue" language
for systems integration, among other things. Python developers have many
choices of runtime environments, including CPython, JVM (Jython), and .NET
(IronPython).

See [http://www.python.org/about/quotes/](http://www.python.org/about/quotes/) to find out
how organizations around the world are using Python.
